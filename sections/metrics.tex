\section{Applying Metrics To UML Models}\label{metrics}

An \umlS model can be made from different diagrams, each one with a distinct view of the system. Use Cases diagrams expose the system functional requirements and how each user interacts with them. They are a good overview in what features the system offers to the end user.

Class Diagrams represent the blueprint of the application under the developer perspective: they illustrate which programming components a system has and how they related to each other.

Package Diagrams describe how to group the classes and how these groups relate to each other (\textit{package import}, \textit{package merge}).

%We believe that an \umlS diagram need to have at least these three diagrams implemented, because they give to both the costumer and the developer the full knowledge of the system.

Here we present some metrics related to this three fundamental diagrams and conclude the section by explaining some metrics for other \umlS diagrams.
