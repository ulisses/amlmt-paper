\subsection{Object-Oriented Software: \textrm{CK} Metrics}
One of the most popular suites of OO metrics was proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer \cite{Chidamber:1994:MSO:630808.631131} to capture different aspects of OO designs, including complexity, coupling and cohesion. 
As we can see in~\cite{Power2}, they were posteriorly adapted for modeling languages and can be easly applied to \uml\ class diagrams.

This suite is composed by six metrics: \emph{Weighted Methods Per Class} (WMC), \emph{Depth of Inheritance Tree} (DIT), \emph{Number of Children} (NOC), \emph{Response For a Class} (RFC), \emph{Coupling between Object Classes} (CBO) and, finally, \emph{Lack of Cohesion in Methods} (LCOM).
We detail bellow each metric and its features.

\paragraph{Weighted methods per class} (WMC) - This metric regards to the complexity of a class method, being equal to the sum of those methods complexities. There are two kinds of WMC metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{$WMC1_{1}$} is computed from a class diagram by counting the number of methods in that class - considering each method as an unity;
\item \textbf{$WMC_{cc}$} is computed by counting the number of methods in each class, based on the result of the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity of each method.
%This metric requires information from other kind of diagrams, like Sequence or Activity diagrams.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Depth of inheritance tree} (DIT) - This metric is equal to the maximum length from the class to the root of the inheritance, which could be defined as the depth of the class. It is computed by taking the union of all the class diagrams in a \uml\ model and traversing the inheritance hierarchy of the class.

\paragraph{Number of children} (NOC) - This metric represents the number of childs and descendants of a certain class. Can be obtained gathering all diagrams class, in a \uml\ modulation, and checking all the inheritance relations of the class.

\paragraph{Response for a class} (RFC) - This metric measures the number of methods that can be invoked by an object of a given class. It can be obtained from a class diagram and from behavior diagrams (e.g. sequence diagrams), which can inform of several methods of other classes that are invoked by each of the class methods.

\paragraph{Coupling between object classes} (CBO) - Two classes are related if a method of a class uses a instance variable or method of another class.
Thus, we can compute this metric by counting the number of classes to which the class is related and counting all kind of references of the attributes and parameters of the class methods.
%Counting the number of classes to which the class is related and counting all kind of references of the attributes and parameters of the class methods, an estimate of this metric value can be obtained from the class diagrams. 
Though, it is possible to calculate a more precise value if behavioral diagrams are taken into account, since the usage of instance variable and invocation methods are additional information.

\paragraph{Lack of cohesion in methods} (LCOM) - It measures the number of sets of instance variables accessed by every pair of methods of a given class, that has a non-empty intersection. For this, is essential to use the information of the usage instance variables by the methods of a class -- i.e., since a class diagram does not have information about the usage, it is required a sequence diagram.\\

This set of metrics can be found and cited in several papers -- like~\cite{Power2} -- and represent the basis of all the existing metrics for OO systems.
