\subsection{Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect}
\def \entArch {\textsf{Enterprise Architect}}
Sparx Systems \entArch\ is another tool that provides modeling of UML diagrams.
It supports mind map diagrams and project management, to provide full traceability from requirements specification to deployment end implementation.
This tool also provides also some metrics evaluation to compute the complexity of a project only based on Use Case diagrams. 

To perform this evaluation, the user needs to provide a level of implementation complexity to each interaction with authors. 
This task can be done when defining the Use Case descriptions or when performing the metrics evaluation.

To evaluate the metrics, \entArch\ have a wizard, that gives also other options to do the complexity analysis.
This options manipulates the Technical complexity and also Environment complexity and be used to adapt the evaluation and perform a better result on estimation.

Also can be filtered the Use Cases used in evaluation. 
To filter can be used manual selection or regular expressions over use case name.
This kind of filtering ables the project to be distributed and evaluated individually.

The final result presented is the maximum number of working hours needed to perform the implementation.
