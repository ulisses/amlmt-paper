\section{Conclusion} \label{conc}
\entArch is a full formal UML specification environment that also supports metrics. 
It is driven to enterprise market, thus oriented to minimize the cost and time spent with the production process, so the metrics evaluation offered is directed to this goal.

As mentioned, its metrics are oriented to available system functionalities and oriented to Use-case diagrams. 
%bad
We consider this a valid approach, but it requires some extra user interaction in the specification of the complexity of a task.
This complexity could be archived by other means if other types of diagrams were also analyzed.
%good
The final results presented are simple and also oriented to the final cost, but if the complexity has been specified with knowledge of the environment, they could estimate very well the final cost of the implemented system.

Summing up, in metrics evaluation, this tool is a good choice to have an estimation of the implementation cost on a formally specified system, but this is its only goal, it cannot provide any kind of analysis about the quality of specification or do any automatic analysis about complexity of the system.
