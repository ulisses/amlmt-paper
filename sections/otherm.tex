\subsection{Other Diagram Metrics}

Statechart diagrams illustrate the behavior of an object.
They define different states of an object during its lifetime, which are changed by events.
A \emph{state} expresses an action of an object during a certain time, when it don't receive external stimulus nor is there any change in its attributes. 

\begin{table}[h]\centering
\begin{tabular}{ p{2cm} | p{10,5 cm}}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Statechart Metrics}} \\ \hline
\textbf{Métrica}  & \textbf{Descrição} \\ \hline
TEffects  & The number of transitions with an effect in the state machine. \\ \hline 
TGuard & The number of transitions with a guard in the state machine. \\ \hline 
TTrigger & The number of triggers of the transitions of the state machine. \\ \hline 
States & The number of states in the state machine. \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Measures like the \emph{Number of Entry Actions}, \emph{Number of Exit Actions}, \emph{Number of Transitions}, or even the \emph{Number of Activities} are associated to the complexity and dimension of the problem~\cite{EVMmdm}.
In Table~\ref{t:estado} we can notice some examples from measurable attributes for this type of diagram.

Activity diagrams describe work flows and are very useful for detail operations of a class (including behaviors expressed by parallel processing).
As we can see in Table~\ref{t:act} several metrics for this diagrams are available.

\begin{table}[h]\centering
\begin{tabular}{ p{2cm}|   p{10,5 cm}}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Activity Metrics}} \\ \hline
\textbf{Métrica} & \textbf{Descrição} \\ \hline
Actions  & The number of actions of the activity. \\ \hline 
ObjectNodes & The number of object nodes of the activity. \\ \hline 
Pins  & The number of pins on nodes of the activity. \\ \hline 
Guards  & The number of guards defined on object and control flows of the activity. \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\caption{\small{Examples of Activity Diagrams}}
\label{t:act}
\end{table}

Besides these metrics, it is possible to measure attributes like the \emph{Number of Activity Groups/Zones}, the \emph{Number of object flows} or even the \emph{Number of Exceptions} of each diagram.
