\subsection{Class Diagram and Package Metrics}

These diagrams are used to describe the types of objects in a system and the relationships among them.
They describe the structure of a system by showing the system classes, their attributes and methods or operations.
Their quality have a huge impact on the final quality of the software under development, as they describe the general model of the system information.

Measures like the \emph{Number of Attributes in the Class}, the \emph{Number of Operations in the Class}, \emph{Number of Inherited Attributes}, \emph{Number of descents/ancestors of a Class}, or even the \emph{Number of Interfaces Implemented} are used both for indicate the system complexity as for an index of quality.
Many works present several metrics for this diagrams~\cite{DBLP:journals/Lobjet/GeneroPC00},~\cite{Eichelberger_onclass},~\cite{Yi04acomparison}.
The OOA metrics defined in~\cite{Marchesi:1998:OMU:522081.795010} also contemplate Class Diagrams, as we can see in Table~\ref{t:dcm}.


In \uml, classes can be grouped into Packages to define subsystems or even for implementation purposes.
The measurement of a package complexity is useful to forecast the development efforts of it.
For that, we can measure properties like the \emph{Number of Classes of a Package}, the \emph{Total Number of Packages in the system}, or the \emph{Number of Interfaces in the Package}.
Marchesi~\cite{Marchesi:1998:OMU:522081.795010} suggests several Package Metrics as described in Table~\ref{t:pcm} for estimate this complexity.
