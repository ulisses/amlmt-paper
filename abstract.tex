Any traditional engineering field has metrics to rigorously assess the quality of their products.
From a long time ago, engineers know that the production process is not all; the output must comply with 
the rules and good-practices, must satisfy the requirements and must be competitive.\\
Professionals in the new field of software engineering started a few years ago  to define metrics to appraise 
their product: individual programs and software systems.\\
This concern motivates the need to assess not only the outcome but also the process and tools employed in its development.
In this context, assessing the quality of programming languages is a legitimate objective;
in a similar way, it makes sense to be concerned will models and modeling approaches, as more and more
people starts the software development process by a modeling phase.\\
In the paper we discuss the quality of modeling languages, introducing and motivating the topic,
presenting metrics, and comparing tools.
